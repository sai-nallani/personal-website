            here is the math i'm working on right now

            <li>
                omnific integers
            </li>
            <li>
                graph theory
            </li>
            <li>
                measure theory and analysis
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h1>expository papers</h1>
        the best way to learn is to teach. i've tried to learn as much math as possible while writing these two
        expository papers. i hope you learn from them :)
        my papers look neat because of <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/latex-style-guide.html">Evan Chen</a>! check
        out his latex style guide if you also want neat papers.
        <h2><a href="/measure-theory-radon-nikodym-theorem.pdf" target="_blank"> Measure Theory and the Radon--Nikodym
                Theorem </a></h2>
        <p>
            i wrote this paper at Euler Circle, and it introduced measure theory and goes all the way up to the
            Radon--Nikodym theorem.
            you don't need any prerequisites except set theory. <br>

        <p>
            i also wrote this paper at Euler Circle. combinatorial game theory was really hard but i'm glad with the
            way this paper turned out.
            it was kind of challenging trying to digest the original paper, but i hope i explained it a bit better.
            the only prerequisites you would need is basic combinatorial game theory; read the Games section of Conway's
            <em>On Number's and Games</em>. <br>
